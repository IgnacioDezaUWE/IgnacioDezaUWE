- 👋 Hi, I’m Ignacio @IgnacioDezaUWE Senior Lecturer in Data Science at UWE 
- 👀 I’m interested in solving very complex problems with data, and help others to make sense of their datasets
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply Statistical Physics concepts to the weight matrices in AI, as a way to understand how they work
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate in Data Science Projects, especially those who can't be solved by normal Data Science teams.
- 📫 How to reach me: ignacio.deza@uwe.ac.uk, or www.linkedin.com/in/ignaciodeza/
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him but they/them is also good
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was in a blues band playing the Harmonica. And I can play the bagpipes!
